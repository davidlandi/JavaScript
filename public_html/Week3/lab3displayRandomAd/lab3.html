<!-- Created by David Landi 2014. In this lab we had to Create a simple Ad that will display on the page as just text in a div.  
The Ad will be random using Math.random from the array length. The script will run when the page is loaded. This was accomplished
Requirements: Create an array that has five(5) JSON objects, Use Math.random() with the array.length to get a random index, 
Use the array index value to get the ad value from the Json, Display the ad using innerHTML, -->
